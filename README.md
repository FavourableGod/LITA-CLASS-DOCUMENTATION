##This is where i document my journey in Data Analysis

### Day 1 Entry

So I want to let everyone know about the exciting journey that I started in the Tech world about a week ago. Though i failed to started posting immediately i started the program but i will post from now on.I'm super excited and as a professional Accountant, I'm so glad that I chose to improve myself. I will be an ingrate if I fail to acknowledge The Incubator Hub ,(organizers of the program) and the Mummy G O of the RCCG in the person of Mummy Folu Adeboye who created this opportunity for women to connect to the booming world of Tech. May God continue to honor, protect, and preserve you for us, Mummy. and also our Facilitator like no other, Muhsin H. 
for his quality teaching skills and vast knowledge of Data analysis.Thank you sir We are blessed to have you, sir.

So I chose the Data analys track of the Tech world. And this past week has added to my career what I never know is possible. We started with the Basics of Data Analysis where I was informed that by the end of the training, I'm expected to be very proficient in Excel, SQL, and Power BI. It's been an interesting journey.
I learnt about the Data foundation, Data storage, Operation and Analytic system of every organization, Data storage on Premises and Cloud, and data structures.  We also looked at the Data analysis life cycle; 
Ingestion(taking /Collecting data from source), Transformation(changing the structure to your desired one), 
Modeling (bringing different data together to form a single data)
Visualization (Turning data into virtual like charts & Graphs
Analysis(Deploying tools and other factors on your data to get an insight and also do some recommendations) and finally 
Presentation(presenting your findings to the boards).
We learnt that Data Analysis helps us to 
1. Know what is working
2. What is not working 
3. What we should focus on

We also identified the Ribbon interface of the Excel sheet, the tabs, the Access toolbar, Commands, etc.
So I'm very sure that at the end of this training, I will be able to;
1. Collect and clean data
2. Explore and visualize data
3. Analyse data.

All this was discussed in our first class and Indeed, this journey is worthwhile and I promise to keep you updated on my progress. 

Yours truly.
